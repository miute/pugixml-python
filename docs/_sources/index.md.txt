[pugixml](http://pugixml.org/) is a light-weight C++ XML processing library. It features:

- DOM-like interface with rich traversal/modification capabilities
- [Extremely fast](https://pugixml.org/benchmark.html) non-validating XML parser which constructs the DOM tree from an XML file/buffer
- XPath 1.0 implementation for complex data-driven tree queries
- Full Unicode support with Unicode interface variants and automatic encoding conversions

For more information, see pugixml's documentation.
